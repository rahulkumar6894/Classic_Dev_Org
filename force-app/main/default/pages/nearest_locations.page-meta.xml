    <description>Finding nearest locations on google map within Salesforce
Locating anything is just part of our daily habit. Salesforce made is very easy by adding Geolocation to Address field types. So I have did one practice to locate nearest restaurants on google map.

Lets Say I have one Company Record and would l like to plot all restaurants that are located in x unit of distance to company on google map.

To achieve this I am going to use two features of salesforce one is Distance formula

DISTANCE(AddressField, GEOLOCATION(latitude,longitude), &apos;mi&apos;)

and another one is apex:map &amp; apex:mapmarker tag</description>
